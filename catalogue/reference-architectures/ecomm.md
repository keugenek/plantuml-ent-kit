# E-Commerce System Reference Architecture

The E-Commerce system is a quintessential online retail platform that facilitates the buying and selling of products. This reference architecture demonstrates key aspects such as inventory management, online transactions, user authentication, and digital marketing.

## Entities and Relationships

The primary entities in this system include `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, `Shopping Cart`, `Payment`, `Shipping`, `Category`, and `Review`. Here's a simplified ER diagram representing these entities and their relationships:
