# Content Management System (CMS) Reference Architecture

The Content Management System (CMS) serves as a platform to facilitate content creation, organization, publishing, and user engagement. This reference architecture demonstrates the key entities and relationships inherent in a typical CMS.

## Entities and Relationships

The primary entities in a CMS include `User`, `Content Item`, `Category`, `Tag`, `Media`, and `Comment`. Here's a simplified ER diagram representing these entities and their relationships:

```plantuml

!define table(x) class x << (T,#FFAAAA) >>
!define primary_key(x) <b>x</b>
!define foreign_key(x) <color:red>x</color>

table(User) {
  +primary_key(UserID): int
  Username: varchar(255)
  Password: varchar(255)
  Email: varchar(255)
}

table(ContentItem) {
  +primary_key(ContentID): int
  Title: varchar(255)
  Body: text
  PublishDate: date
  +foreign_key(UserID): int
  +foreign_key(CategoryID): int
}

table(Category) {
  +primary_key(CategoryID): int
  CategoryName: varchar(255)
}

table(Tag) {
  +primary_key(TagID): int
  TagName: varchar(255)
}

table(Media) {
  +primary_key(MediaID): int
  MediaType: varchar(50)
  URL: varchar(255)
  +foreign_key(ContentID): int
}

table(Comment) {
  +primary_key(CommentID): int
  CommentText: text
  CommentDate: date
  +foreign_key(UserID): int
  +foreign_key(ContentID): int
}

User -- ContentItem : creates
User -- Comment : writes
ContentItem -- Category : categorized as
ContentItem -- Media : has
ContentItem -- Comment : has
ContentItem -- Tag : tagged as
