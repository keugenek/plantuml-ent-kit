# Learning Management System (LMS) Reference Architecture

The Learning Management System (LMS) serves as a platform to facilitate online education, manage content, engage students, and track performance. This reference architecture demonstrates the key entities and relationships inherent in a typical LMS.

## Entities and Relationships

The primary entities in an LMS include `Course`, `Instructor`, `Student`, `Enrollment`, `Assignment`, and `Grade`. Here's a simplified ER diagram representing these entities and their relationships:

!define table(x) class x << (T,#FFAAAA) >>
!define primary_key(x) <b>x</b>
!define foreign_key(x) <color:red>x</color>

table(Course) {
  +primary_key(CourseID): int
  CourseName: varchar(255)
  Description: text
  +foreign_key(InstructorID): int
}

table(Instructor) {
  +primary_key(InstructorID): int
  FirstName: varchar(255)
  LastName: varchar(255)
  Email: varchar(255)
}

table(Student) {
  +primary_key(StudentID): int
  FirstName: varchar(255)
  LastName: varchar(255)
  Email: varchar(255)
}

table(Enrollment) {
  +primary_key(EnrollmentID): int
  +foreign_key(StudentID): int
  +foreign_key(CourseID): int
  EnrollmentDate: date
}

table(Assignment) {
  +primary_key(AssignmentID): int
  +foreign_key(CourseID): int
  AssignmentName: varchar(255)
  Description: text
  DueDate: date
}

table(Grade) {
  +primary_key(GradeID): int
  +foreign_key(StudentID): int
  +foreign_key(AssignmentID): int
  Score: decimal(5,2)

## Entity Descriptions
- Course: Represents an individual course offered, associated with an instructor, enrollments, and assignments.

## Relationship Descriptions
- A Course is taught by an Instructor, has multiple Enrollments, and has multiple Assignments.
- An Instructor teaches multiple Courses.
- A Student has multiple Enrollments and is assigned multiple Grades.
- An Enrollment is associated with one Student and one Course.
- An Assignment is associated with a Course and has multiple Grades.
- A Grade is assigned to a Student for an Assignment.

This simplified LMS model serves as a basis for understanding the relationships and interactions within a learning management system. It can be further expanded or modified to meet the specific needs of different educational institutions or online education platforms.
